                <p style='margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px'>His trip to the South Pole started on the 11th of November. With 52 dogs, four sleds, five people and 33 days later they reached the South Pole on December 14, 1911.</p>
                <p style='margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px'>He was born on the 16th of July 1872 and died 18th of June 1928 aged 56. He had four brothers (Gustav Zahlqvist, Leon Henry Benham, Kasper and Jens Ole Antonio. He was never married.</p>
                <p style='margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px'>Amundsen disappeared on 18 June 1928 while flying on a rescue mission in the Arctic and was never seen again.</p>
                <h3 style='margin-left: 20px;'>Robert Falcon Scott</h3>
                <p style='margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px'>Was born on the 6th of June 1869 and died on the 29 March 1912 after reaching the South Pole.</p>
                <p style='margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px'>He had five siblings and a wife (Kathleen Bruce) whom he had a child with (Peter Markham Scott).</p>
                <p style='margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px'>He was in a race to get to the South Pole but unfortunately, he came second. His expedition had so many complications that it killed him. He died in a tent on the South Pole.</p>
                <h3 style='margin-left: 20px;'>Fridtjof Nansen</h3>
                <p style='margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px'>He was born on the 10th of October 1861 and died in Lysaker 13th of May 1930.</p>
                <p style='margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px'>In 1888 he went skiing across Greenland.</p>
                <p style='margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px'>He was the leader of the "Fram" expedition that lasted 3 years. That is all I know about him pls help.</p>
                <h3 style='margin-left: 20px;'>Ernest Shackleton</h3>
                <p style='margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px'>Born on the 15th February 1874 and died 47 years later on the 5th January 1922.

                <p style='margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px'>In 1901 he was chosen for the Antarctic expedition with Robert Scott but he became ill and couldn't go.</p>
                <p style='margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px'>He then came back in 1908 with the ship Nimrod. He and his crew climbed Mount Erebus (second-highest volcano in Antarctica). That helped some important discoveries such as: discovery of the approximate location of the South Magnetic Pole, partly discovered the Beardmore Glacier... And he set a record for coming even closer to the South Pole.</p>
                <p style='margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px'>He is best known for leading the 'Endurance' expedition of 1914-16.</p>
                <p style='margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px'>In 1914, it was the 3rd trip to the Antarctic. The ship got trapped in the ice in 1915 and later sank. They abandoned the ship and lived on the ice for almost a year. In 1916 three small boats went to get help and every single person on the ship survived.</p>
                <p style='margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px'>A fourth expedition was planned to navigate around the Antarctic, but he died of a heart attack in South Georgia. He was buried there.</p>
